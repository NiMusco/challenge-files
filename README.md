## :electric_plug: Installation

The project is set up to run with Docker Compose:

1. **Pre-requisites**: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project root directory.
4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the environment variables as necessary.
5. Run `docker-compose up --build` to build and start the containers.

React frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:${FRONTEND_PORT}`

NestJS API being at `http://localhost:${BACKEND_PORT}`

## :computer: Environment Configuration:

- **DB Configuration**: Customize DB user, password, and database name through the `.env` file.
- **Backend Configuration**: Set up database connection details, AWS credentials for file storage, and JWT secret for authentication.
- **Frontend Configuration**: Configure the API URL and S3 bucket URL for accessing services.

##### Other Considerations:

- The backend utilizes TypeORM for database interactions, providing an ORM layer for working with Postgres.
- The frontend leverages React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
